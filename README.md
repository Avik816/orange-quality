## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset is assumed to contain various physicochemical properties of oranges (e.g., size, color, acidity, etc.) and a quality rating label. These attributes are used to build predictive models.

---

## 📌 Goals

- Build a robust machine learning model that can predict orange quality.
- Provide interpretability and performance insights.
- Use a reproducible and modular code structure.
